# SI 206 Final Project
Our first goal was to compare the stats between Lebron James and Michael Jordan. However, after beginning the project we would not have enough data to insert into the database for each player. Once this was assessed we decided to go down a different path. Instead, we decided to compare the top 100 players in the NBA based on points. From the 100 players our goal was to find our own way to measure the overall efficiency, turnover ratio and division counts for each of the players. Overall we wanted to find the player with the highest points per minute, the player with the highest turnovers per minute, and the division with the most top 100 players. Another goal was to be able to find a correlation between the data we selected and be able to visualize it so anyone can understand.
